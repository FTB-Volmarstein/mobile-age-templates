Along with his teammates, \n    he also set the world record in the 4x100 metres relay. He is the reigning Olympic champion \n    in these three events, the first man to win six Olympic gold medals in sprinting, \n    and a five-time World champion. He was the first to achieve a \"double double\" by winning \n    100m and 200m titles at consecutive Olympics (2008 and 2012), and topped this through \n    the first \"double triple\" (including 4x100m relays).\n  </div>\n</div>\n</article>","onData":"","onTemplate":""}
