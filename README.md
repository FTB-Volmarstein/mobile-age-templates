# mobile-age-templates
Templates to be used with/by the Generic Front-End Components developed within the Mobile-Age Project.

For comfortable editing of the templates, [hjson.org] (HJSON)  is used and converted to JSON by a grunt-task.

Installation as usual:

`git clone https://github.com/FTB-Volmarstein/mobile-age-templates.git`

`npm install`

Edit files in src-folder and run grunt's default task. This will write a corresponding JSON-file to the root directory.
